# GAP-10: @mock Directive Specification

## Overview

This proposal defines the `@mock` directive, enabling GraphQL clients to return
mocked data for fields or entire operations. Mock data is stored statically in
JSON files alongside the operations that use them.

## Motivation

Client and backend developers often work in parallel, but clients cannot build
against schema that isn't yet implemented. The `@mock` directive lets client
developers define and use mock responses for fields and types that may not yet
be present in the server schema, unblocking frontend development.

## FAQs

### Conditional response based on list position

This specification does not support conditional use of mock values in individual array
positions. You may, however, hoist usage of `@mock` to the parent node that returns
a list and return an array containing different values.

**Example**

Consider the following query:

```graphql
query PetStorePets {
  dogsForSale {
    name @mock(value: "fido")
  }
}
```

This might produce the following response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "dogsForSale": [
      { "name": "fido" },
      { "name": "fido" },
      { "name": "fido" }
    ]
  }
}
```

For the purposes of a mock user interface, this might be ok! If you wanted to
change the value for each item in the list, you would need to mock at a higher
level:

```graphql
query PetStorePets {
  dogsForSale @mock(variant: "3-dogs-for-sale") {
    name
  }
}
```

#### Future Proposal

We may in future extend this specification to allow for a random pick of
multiple mock values:

```graphql
query PetStorePets {
  dogsForSale {
    name @mock(value: "john") @mock(value: "ringo") @mock(value: "paul")
  }
}
```

This may produce the following response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "dogsForSale": [
      { "name": "paul" },
      { "name": "ringo" },
      { "name": "paul" }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Why don't we allow specifying an array position?

<details>

Consider the following query:

```graphql
query GetUserFavorites {
  businessesNearMe {
    menuItems {
      name
      price
    }
  }
}
```

Consider that we wish to mock a new field that does not yet exist on the server;
`blurHash`:

```graphql
query GetUserFavorites {
  businessesNearMe {
    menuItems {
      name
      price
      photo {
        url
        blurHash @mock(value: "LEHV6nWB2yk8pyo0adR*.7kCMdnj")
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Currently, all list items in the user interface will use the same string for
`blurHash` - we have no way to use different values for different positions in
the list.

A tempting option might be to add a "list position argument" that the client
can interpret to merge in the mock value in the right position:

```graphql
query GetUserFavorites {
  businessesNearMe {
    menuItems {
      name
      price
      photo {
        url
        blurHash
          @mock(value: "LEHV6nWB2yk8pyo0adR*.7kCMdnj", nth_child: 0)
          @mock(value: "L6PZfSi_.AyE_3t7t7R**0o#DgR4", nth_child: 1)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

_(Fans of CSS will find
[`nth_child`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Selectors/:nth-child)
familiar.)_

However, there are issues with this API:

##### 1. Parent Ambiguity

Which list parent does `nth-child` apply to? There are two list parents of
`Photo.blurHash`: (1) `Query.businessesNearMe` and (2) `Business.menuItems`.

We would need an even more complicated API to resolve this ambiguity.

##### 2. Order Instability

Results from the server may not be stable over long periods of time.

Consider this example that searches book stores for available books:

```graphql
query BooksInStock {
  findBookInStock(name: "Fly Fishing", author: "JR Hartley") {
    inStock
    storeDetails { name address } @mock(..., nth_child: 0)
  }
}
```

The data the server returns may change over time, either due to:

1. Organic results change
2. The server changes behavior (e.g. a default `orderBy` parameter changes from
   `ASC to `DESC` -- this should not happen by convention, but we cannot rely on
   this.)

This means that the result object that the mocked field is merged into may
change over time - resulting in a different UI state than was intended,
potentially leading to nonsensical or broken UI states.

##### 3. Abstract types 

```graphql
query BooksInStock {
  findBookInStock(name: "Fly Fishing", author: "JR Hartley") {
    inStock
    ... on PhysicalStore {
      storeDetails { name address } @mock(..., nth_child: 3)
    }
    ... on Website {
      websiteDetails { name url } @mock(..., nth_child: 3)
    }
  }
}
```

It is ambiguous if the `nth_child` applies to the concrete or abstract type.
i.e. does `nth_child: 3` means "the third occurrence of PhysicalStore
specifically" or "the third element of `findBookInStock`"?

This is particularly problematic where applied inside a fragment defined in a
separate file, and it's not obvious that the fragment is even called inside of
a list!

And what if that fragment is reused in multiple queries, both as a list and not
as a list? 🤯

##### Summary

Although complex, the issues above are solvable in theory. However given the
complexity, the current version of this specification does not support this.

If you have ideas for how to solve this, please send a pull request for a future
spec version :)

### Mocking on inline fragments and fragment spreads

`@mock` is not supported on inline fragments or fragment spreads:

```graphql
query Foo {
  barOrBaz {
    # not supported
    ... on Bar @mock(variant: "mock-bar") {
      hello
    }
    # not supported
    ... on Baz @mock(variant: "mock-baz") {
      world
    }
  }
  qux {
    # not supported
    ...QuxFields @mock(variant: "mock-qux")
  }
}
```

Instead, apply `@mock` to individual fields within the fragment:

```graphql
query Foo {
  barOrBaz {
    ... on Bar {
      hello @mock(value: "hi")
    }
    ... on Baz {
      world @mock(value: "earth")
    }
  }
}
```

<summary>Why not?</summary>

#### New types are unreachable

The primary motivation for `@mock` is building against schema that doesn't yet
exist. But when a type condition references a new type, the server will never
return that type in its response — so the mock data has nowhere to be merged.

```graphql
query PetStore {
  forSale {
    ... on Dog {
      breed
    }
    # Fish doesn't exist in the schema yet.
    # The server will never return __typename: "Fish",
    # so this mock data can never be inserted.
    ... on Fish @mock(variant: "clownfish") {
      species
    }
  }
}
```

For the non-list case, the client could force-overlay the mock data, but this
means overriding the server's type resolution — semantically different from what
`@mock` does elsewhere, where it merges data into a known position in the
response tree.

For the list case, the client would need to *inject* new objects into the array,
raising the same position-ambiguity problems described in
[Why don't we allow specifying an array position?](#why-dont-we-allow-specifying-an-array-position).

#### `__typename` dependency

Merging mock data for a type condition requires knowing which type the server
resolved. This means the client must rely on `__typename` being present in the
response. While common (especially with normalized caches), this is not
guaranteed — adding an implicit runtime dependency that field-level mocking
does not have.

#### Dead mock branches

When multiple type conditions have `@mock`, only the branch matching the
server's resolved type will trigger. The other mock variants exist in the mock
file but are dead code for that response. This makes it harder to validate that
mock data stays in sync with the operation over time, since stale mocks in
non-matching branches won't surface as errors.

#### Fragment spread precedence

For `...QuxFields @mock(variant: "mock-qux")`, the fragment `QuxFields` may
be defined in a separate file with its own mock file (`QuxFields.json`)
containing field-level `@mock` directives. It is unclear which mocks take
precedence — the spread-level mock or the individual field-level mocks inside
the fragment — creating a composition problem that does not exist with
field-level mocking.
